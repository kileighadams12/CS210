Module 8 Assignment


**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

  -Calculating investment growth without monthly deposits
  
  -Calculating investment growth with monthly deposits
  
  -Determining the time needed to reach a specific savings goal

  
**What did you do particularly well?**

  -The code is organized into specific functions for different calculations, making it easy to maintain and modify.
  
  -The program provides clear formatting and presentation of the financial data using proper alignment and precision settings.

  
**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
  
  -Implement a class structure to encapsulate the investment calculator functionality
  
  -Add const correctness to function parameters where appropriate
  
  -Implement exception handling for potential numerical overflow scenarios
  
  -Add input range validation for interest rates (preventing unrealistic values)

  
**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
  
  -Implementing the compound interest calculations correctly, especially with monthly deposits
  
  -Creating well-formatted output that aligns properly and is easy to read


**Overcame this by:**

  -Using appropriate data types and precision settings for financial calculations
  
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
  
  -Understanding and implementing compound interest calculations
  
  -Experience with creating well-formatted, readable output
  
  -Breaking down complex calculations into manageable functions

  
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  
  -The modular design allows for easy addition of new features
  
  -Separate functions for different calculations make it easy to modify individual components
